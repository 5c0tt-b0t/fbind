# v2017.9.18 (20179180)
- [TEST] auto-add storage access permissions to /data/system/packages.xml -- perm pkg_name
- Ability to move bind_mnt() data (fbind -m) when a 3rd argument is present (i.e., "bind_mnt data/FOLDER $intsd/FOLDER X")
- User variables
- No longer bind-mounting /data/_fbind to $intsd/_fbind.
- Minor optimizations
- Updated reference

# v2017.9.18.1 (20179181)
- Fixed bind_mnt()
- Fixed fbind cmd
- Updated reference

# v2017.9.26 (20179260)
- Those facing bind issues, please double check your config file for errors...
-- there's a small chance config_updater.sh might have messed with it a bit during 20179160 build update.
- Updated reference (please READ/RE-READ config_samples.txt & README.txt).
- Added critical flag -- bind_mnt, mv only if $3 = "-mv".
- Added ability to unmount (fbind -u) /data/data/app -- flag -u -- i.e., app_data com.spotify.music -u).
- app_data() works with internal storage too -- reduce the size of TWRP backups by saving huge app data to $intsd/.app_data.
-- The line "extsd_path $intsd" must be present in your config file.
- fbind -u affects bind_mnt() as well.
- Rearranged $PATH elements to avoid/fix busybox issues.
- int_extf() is back.
- MASSIVE optimizations
- Auto-grant storage permissions to ALL apps by default (platform.xml patch & auto-re-patch across ROM updates).
-- Alternate method uses "pm grant" -- add the line "perms" to your config file if the above method doesn't work.
--- This one might take a while to complete (first time only)
