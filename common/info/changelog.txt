# v2017.9.26 (20179260)
- Those facing bind issues, please double check your config file for errors...
-- there's a small chance config_updater.sh might have messed with it a bit during 20179160 build update.
- Updated reference (please READ/RE-READ config_samples.txt & README.txt).
- Added critical flag -- bind_mnt, mv only if $3 = "-mv".
- Added ability to unmount (fbind -u) /data/data/app -- flag -u -- i.e., app_data com.spotify.music -u).
- app_data() works with internal storage too -- reduce the size of TWRP backups by saving huge app data to $intsd/.app_data.
-- The line "extsd_path $intsd" must be present in your config file.
- fbind -u affects bind_mnt() as well.
- Rearranged $PATH elements to avoid/fix busybox issues.
- int_extf() is back.
- MASSIVE optimizations
- Auto-grant storage permissions to ALL apps by default (platform.xml patch & auto-re-patch across ROM updates).
-- Alternate method uses "pm grant" -- add the line "perms" to your config file if the above method doesn't work.
--- This one might take a while to complete (first time only)

# v2017.9.27 (20179270)
- Fixed from_to bind error.
- You can now add `fsck -OPTION(s) /path/to/partition` to your config file (i.e., `fsck.f2fs -f /dev/block/mmcblk1`). This will check for/fix SD card errors before system gets a chance to mount it.
- Updated reference.

# v2017.9.27.1 (20179271)
- Fixed bind-mount app_data to intsd.
- Now, if extsd path is null/unspecified ("extsd_path" with nothing in front), fbind will auto detect it.

# v2017.9.27.2 (20179272)
- Default SD card search path is no longer limited to "/mnt/media_rw/XXXX-XXXX". So, setting "extsd_path PATH" is no longer necessary if the path to the storage device starts with "/mnt/media_rw".
- Updated reference

# v2017.9.27.3 (20179273)
- Fixed SD card detection mechanism.
